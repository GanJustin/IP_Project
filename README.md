# IP-Project

The goal of our app is to ultimately inform the public more on the covid situation and let those who want to actively search out information on the situation a easy place to access all the news at once.

## Design Process

The goal of our app is to educate people about the whole covid situation, as such we appeal to the philanthropist who are trying to understand the situation without having to search up multiple sites, for Achievers these people want to show their great knowledge on covid so we encourage this through our great amount of quizzes and a leaderboard so that they can display their knowledge publicly to a larger audience, for the consumers who act based on the rewards we decided on adding real world rewards to our app, for the Self Seekers who mainly want to help others for recognition we designed a public comment section so as to allow them to show publicly that they are helping others.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
